# Emby Evidence Log

Confirmed patterns and class behaviours for use in future Emby plugin development sessions.
Evidence should be treated as strong guidance, but not as absolute truth — Emby is a moving target and the internal implementation can change at any time.

## Channel Registration

`IChannel` implementations are **auto-discovered** by Emby at server startup via `ChannelManager.AddParts(GetExports<IChannel>())`. No manual `AddParts` call in plugin code is needed or correct. Same auto-discovery applies to `IScheduledTask`. Simply implement the interface as a public class in the plugin assembly.

## IChannel Interface (MediaBrowser.Controller.Channels)

```
string Name { get; }
string Description { get; }
ChannelParentalRating ParentalRating { get; }
Task<ChannelItemResult> GetChannelItems(InternalChannelItemQuery query, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
Task<DynamicImageResponse> GetChannelImage(ImageType type, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
IEnumerable<ImageType> GetSupportedChannelImages()
```

## IChannelManager (MediaBrowser.Controller.Channels)

```
int ChannelCount { get; }
T GetChannel<T>() where T : IChannel   // returns the server's own registered instance — use this, never inject your own
Task RefreshChannelContent(IChannel channel, int maxRefreshLevel, string restrictTopLevelFolderId, CancellationToken)
```

**Critical**: `RefreshChannelContent` validates its argument against the server's internally registered instances. Passing a separately-constructed instance throws `ArgumentException: The channel could not be found`. Always use `GetChannel<T>()` to retrieve the instance.

**Critical**: `RefreshChannelContent` alone does NOT persist channel items into Emby's database. It signals intent but does not assign `InternalId`/`Guid` or run metadata providers. Only Emby's own built-in **"Refresh Internet Channels"** task does the actual persistence (confirmed by `ILibraryManager.ItemAdded` events firing only after that task runs).

## Triggering "Refresh Internet Channels" Programmatically

Use `ITaskManager.ScheduledTasks` to find the worker, matched by `IScheduledTaskWorker.ScheduledTask.Key`:

```csharp
var worker = taskManager.ScheduledTasks
    .FirstOrDefault(w => string.Equals(w.ScheduledTask?.Key, "RefreshInternetChannels", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase))
    ?? taskManager.ScheduledTasks
        .FirstOrDefault(w => string.Equals(w.Name, "Refresh Internet Channels", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase));

await taskManager.Execute(worker, new TaskOptions());
```

Key `"RefreshInternetChannels"` confirmed stable and non-localized on Emby 4.10. Name `"Refresh Internet Channels"` is a localization-fragile fallback.

## IScheduledTaskWorker (MediaBrowser.Model.Tasks)

```
IScheduledTask ScheduledTask { get; }   // gives access to Key
string Name { get; }
string Id { get; }
TaskState State { get; }
TaskTriggerInfo[] Triggers { get; set; }
```

## ChannelItemInfo (MediaBrowser.Controller.Channels)

Key fields confirmed working:
- `Id` — your own stable string key (e.g. `"radarr-coming-soon-{tmdbId}"`)
- `Name`, `OriginalTitle`, `Overview`, `ProductionYear`, `ImageUrl`
- `Type = ChannelItemType.Media`
- `MediaType = ChannelMediaType.Video` (MediaBrowser.Model.Channels)
- `ContentType = ChannelMediaContentType.Movie` (MediaBrowser.Model.Channels)
- `ProviderIds` — plain `Dictionary<string,string>`; keys `"Tmdb"` and `"Imdb"` are recognised by Emby and show in the metadata UI
- `MediaSources` — populated as a secondary hint but **not** what Emby actually calls at playback time (see `IRequiresMediaInfoCallback` below)

## Item Removal (Implicit Reconciliation)

Removal is **purely implicit**. When "Refresh Internet Channels" runs, it calls `GetChannelItems` and reconciles Emby's database against the returned list. Items no longer returned are deleted (`ILibraryManager.ItemRemoved` fires). `ISupportsDelete.DeleteItem` is **not** called during normal sync reconciliation — it only applies to user-initiated deletes from Emby's own UI. No explicit delete call is needed in the sync task.

## ISupportsDelete (MediaBrowser.Controller.Channels)

```
bool CanDelete(BaseItem item)
Task DeleteItem(string id, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
```

Implement to gate user-initiated deletes from Emby's UI. Not required for sync-driven removal.

## IRequiresMediaInfoCallback (MediaBrowser.Controller.Channels)

```
Task<IEnumerable<MediaSourceInfo>> GetChannelItemMediaInfo(string id, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
```

**This is the actual mechanism Emby calls at playback time** (via the `PlaybackInfo` POST request). Emby does NOT use `ChannelItemInfo.MediaSources` populated in `GetChannelItems` to resolve playback. If this interface is not implemented, playback always fails with "No compatible streams". Populate `MediaSourceInfo.Path` with a real on-disk file path (`Protocol = MediaProtocol.File`) for Direct Play of a local stub video.

## Channel Items vs Library Items

Channel items do not have a folder on disk. A single shared stub file can be pointed at by all channel items' `MediaSourceInfo.Path`. Extract the stub once from the plugin's embedded resource to a persistent disk location (e.g. `IApplicationPaths.DataPath/manage-coming-soon/stub.mp4`) and reuse it. Never re-extract if the file already exists.

## Channel Persistence and Database Identity

Emby stores a `Channel` entity in its database keyed by `IChannel.Name`. The channel's `InternalId` and `Guid` are assigned when "Refresh Internet Channels" first persists it. If `IChannel.Name` changes (e.g. user renames the channel via config), Emby creates a **new** `Channel` DB row — the old one becomes a stale orphan. Tags on channel items can be used as the identity anchor for orphan detection.

## Radarr API Authentication

Query string format: `GET {RadarrUrl}/api/v3/movie?apikey={apiKey}`
Also send `X-Api-Key` header as fallback (some reverse proxies strip one or the other).
Return `null` (not empty list) on any failure — callers must treat null as "sync skipped, leave existing state untouched", never as "zero movies qualify".

## InternalChannelItemQuery (MediaBrowser.Controller.Channels)

```
string FolderId { get; set; }
long UserId { get; set; }
int? StartIndex { get; set; }
int? Limit { get; set; }
```

## ChannelParentalRating (MediaBrowser.Controller.Channels)

`ChannelParentalRating.GeneralAudience` — confirmed member name.

Roadmap item 4 (Channel image) — DONE.
Confirmed working solution, minimal form:
csharpprivate void ReapplyChannelImage(BaseItem item)
{
    if (item.HasImage(ImageType.Primary))
    {
        return; // only ever needs to run once per item
    }

    var imagePath = ResolveChannelImagePath(); // extract embedded thumb.png to disk once, cache path thereafter
    var imageSize = imageProcessor.GetImageSize(imagePath); // IImageProcessor — real Width/Height required, zero values silently fail to render

    item.SetImage(new ItemImageInfo
    {
        Path = imagePath,
        Type = ImageType.Primary,
        DateModified = DateTimeOffset.UtcNow,
        Width = (int)imageSize.Width,
        Height = (int)imageSize.Height
    }, 0);

    libraryManager.UpdateImages(item); // sufficient alone — no UpdateToRepository/UpdateItem or IProviderManager.OnRefreshComplete needed
}
Key findings for evidence log:

IChannel.GetChannelImage/GetSupportedChannelImages are called by Emby exactly once, at the moment "Refresh Internet Channels" first persists a new Channel DB row (keyed by Name). Never re-invoked for an existing row — confirmed by direct test (deleted image via UI, re-browsed, zero calls).
Renaming the channel (RadarrChannelName) forces a new DB row and orphans the old one — same mechanism, now with a live orphan example seen in testing.
ItemImageInfo.Width/Height must be real values from IImageProcessor.GetImageSize(path), not left at 0 — suspected (not fully isolated) to be why initial attempts didn't render despite the DB record looking correct in Edit Images.
Setting BaseItem.ImageInfos via SetImage alone does not make Emby's live web API serve the image — confirmed via direct test: DB/Edit-Images screen showed it correctly, but the running server didn't serve it until an unrelated full restart.
ILibraryManager.UpdateImages(BaseItem) alone is sufficient to invalidate/propagate to the live server without a restart. BaseItem.UpdateToRepository(ItemUpdateType.ImageUpdate) and IProviderManager.OnRefreshComplete(item, collectionFolders) are not required in addition — confirmed by direct isolation test.
item.HasImage(ImageType.Primary) is the correct guard to make this idempotent/cheap — avoids re-running on every sync.
Channel.CanDelete() is hardcoded false — orphaned Channel rows cannot be removed via the standard ILibraryManager.DeleteItem path. IChannelManager.DeleteItem(BaseItem) is an unexplored, more promising lead for roadmap item #2 (orphan cleanup) — not yet tested.
RadarrChannelIdentityTag (fixed tag, independent of RadarrChannelName) is implemented and confirmed working — survives renames, correctly distinguishes current channel from orphans via InternalItemsQuery.Tags + Name matching.

TitleSlug as Radarr's primary identity (this session)
Radarr's internal numeric movie.Id (Radarr's own DB primary key) does not correspond to any real Radarr URL. Radarr's own web UI and API use titleSlug for movie detail URLs (/movie/{titleSlug}). For the two real movies tested, titleSlug happened to equal tmdbId as a string — this is not guaranteed to always be true (Radarr's slugs are normally derived from title text, e.g. mission-impossible-1996); treat this as observed behavior for the tested data, not a documented Radarr guarantee. TitleSlug is now the identity used for:

ChannelItemInfo.Id (BuildItemId)
ProviderIds["RadarrId"] (via RadarrExternalId's clickable URL)
ISupportsDelete.DeleteItem matching

If TitleSlug is ever empty/null for a given Radarr movie, that item is dropped from the channel entirely (logged at Warn) rather than risk an ambiguous/duplicate identity under some fallback scheme. TmdbId was considered as a fallback but explicitly rejected — kept incidental, used only for Emby's own recognized ProviderIds["Tmdb"] key, not for our own identity logic.
ILibraryManager.UpdateItem — confirmed working for correcting stale ProviderIds
void UpdateItem(BaseItem item, BaseItem parent, ItemUpdateType updateReason);
Confirmed via live test: setting item.ProviderIds["SomeKey"] = newValue then calling this overload persists correctly and fires ILibraryManager.ItemUpdated. This is the same overload already used successfully elsewhere in this codebase for the Channel item's identity tag (ApplyIdentityTag).
IChannelManager.DeleteItem — confirmed working
Task DeleteItem(BaseItem item);
Confirmed via live test: called against an orphaned Channel BaseItem (found via tag query, name mismatch against current config), it fully removes the item from Emby's database (log evidence: "Removing item from database", associated metadata path deletions, ILibraryManager.ItemRemoved event). This was previously an unexplored lead per the roadmap; it is now a confirmed, working mechanism.
IExternalId — confirmed working
csharppublic interface IExternalId
{
    string Name { get; }
    string Key { get; }
    string UrlFormatString { get; }
    bool Supports(IHasProviderIds item);
}
Auto-discovered the same way as IChannel/IScheduledTask (via GetExports<T>()), no manual registration needed. UrlFormatString is evaluated per-render, so it can safely read live plugin configuration (ManageComingSoonPlugin.Instance.Configuration.RadarrUrl) rather than needing a static/hardcoded URL. {0} in the format string is substituted with whatever value is stored under the matching ProviderIds[Key].
Confirmed: IHasSupportedExternalIdentifiers (a separate interface, tied to IRemoteMetadataProvider) was not needed just to make the ID clickable/visible — IExternalId alone was sufficient for this plugin's narrow "surface for troubleshooting" goal. IHasSupportedExternalIdentifiers would only be relevant if the plugin needed to act as a genuine Emby metadata provider (Identify/Refresh Metadata workflows) — explicitly out of scope, confirmed with the user.
InternalItemsQuery — additional confirmed members (this session)
public BaseItem Parent { get; set; }  // setter also populates ParentIds internally
public long[] ParentIds { get; set; }
Parent is the simpler way to scope a query to children of a specific BaseItem (e.g. Movie items under a Channel) — confirmed working via the post-sync diagnostic query in this session.

## Channel Registration Cannot Be Conditional at Runtime

`GetExports<T>(bool manageLiftime, IList<Type> excludeTypes)` (Emby's internal
MEF-style export scanner, confirmed via ILSpy decompilation of the internal
export/composition assembly) only supports excluding types from a caller-
supplied list at the call site — there is no predicate, instance check, or
config lookup available to the exported type itself. `CreateInstanceSafe` is
called unconditionally for every type found implementing the requested
interface. This means an `IChannel` implementation (or `IScheduledTask`, same
mechanism) cannot opt out of being registered based on its own runtime state
(e.g. a plugin config flag) — registration is decided purely by "does this
type exist in a loaded assembly," at server startup, before any plugin
config is even read. The only way to prevent registration is for the type
not to exist in the assembly at all (conditional compilation / separate
optional DLL) — not achievable via a runtime toggle.

## Channel Entities Cannot Be Hidden or Kept Deleted While the Plugin Is Loaded

Confirmed via direct live testing (see chat history) while investigating a
"disable this channel" feature:

- `IChannelManager.DeleteItem(BaseItem item)` is NOT a generic "delete this
  BaseItem" call, despite the name. Decompiled body:
```csharp
  public Task DeleteItem(BaseItem item)
  {
      Channel channelFromItem = GetChannelFromItem(item);
      if (channelFromItem == null) return Task.CompletedTask;
      if (!(GetChannelProvider(channelFromItem) is ISupportsDelete supportsDelete))
          return Task.CompletedTask;
      return supportsDelete.DeleteItem(item.ExternalId, CancellationToken.None);
  }
```
  It treats `item` as **content belonging to a channel** and routes to that
  channel's own `ISupportsDelete.DeleteItem`. Calling it against the Channel
  BaseItem itself silently no-ops (`GetChannelFromItem` returns null for a
  Channel, since a Channel isn't "in" a channel).

- The real generic BaseItem-removal path is `ILibraryManager.DeleteItem(item,
  DeleteOptions)`. Confirmed working directly against a Channel BaseItem —
  goes straight to `ItemRepository.DeleteItems`, fires `ItemRemoved`, deletes
  the item's metadata folder. `DeleteFileLocation = false` is sufficient
  since a Channel has no on-disk path.

- **However**: the deleted Channel row does NOT stay deleted. Emby's own
  built-in "Refresh Internet Channels" scheduled task (`RefreshInternetChannels`)
  re-registers a DB row for every currently-exported `IChannel` on every run,
  completely independent of any plugin-level enabled/disabled config — it has
  no concept of "disabled." Confirmed via direct test: delete the Channel
  row, run "Refresh Internet Channels" again (on its own trigger schedule, a
  manual trigger, or via our own sync task if it ever calls it), and the row
  reappears — same `Guid` (name-derived), new `InternalId` (fresh DB row).

- **Also confirmed**: an empty channel (zero content items) is NOT auto-hidden
  by Emby's Channels UI. Zero items ≠ invisible.

- **The only confirmed way to hide a channel from a user** is
  `UserPolicy.EnableAllChannels = false` + populating `UserPolicy.EnabledChannels`
  with every *other* channel's ID for that user — an allow-list, not a
  per-channel deny flag. Rejected as a design for a single plugin's disable
  toggle: it would require enumerating every channel from every plugin on the
  server, doing so per-user, and keeping it in sync as channels/users change
  — invasive overreach into an unrelated area of server administration
  (Dashboard → Users → channel access) for a single plugin's toggle.

**Conclusion**: an Emby channel-type plugin has no supported way to make its
channel disappear from the UI at runtime while its assembly remains loaded.
The practical ceiling for a "disable" feature is: stop all external calls,
return zero content items. The (now-empty) Channel entity itself will always
be visible in the Channels list, and will always be recreated by Emby's own
built-in task if deleted. This is a platform constraint, not a gap in this
plugin's implementation.



Custom Plugin Pages via IHasWebPages (Rules UI session)

Confirmed via live testing while building the Radarr rules editor — a
custom HTML/JS page not built with Emby.Web.GenericEdit.

IHasWebPages (MediaBrowser.Model.Plugins) is a separate, parallel
mechanism to IHasUIPages/Emby.Web.GenericEdit (the mechanism
ConfigurationUI/ConfigurationPageView use):

csharppublic interface IHasWebPages
{
    IEnumerable<PluginPageInfo> GetPages();
}

Confirmed pattern (cross-checked against multiple real public plugins —
Bookshelf, ComSkipper, Statistics, SoundCloud — all identical):

csharppublic IEnumerable<PluginPageInfo> GetPages()
{
    return new[]
    {
        new PluginPageInfo
        {
            Name = "RadarrRulesPage",
            EmbeddedResourcePath = GetType().Namespace + ".Services.Models.Rules.rulesPage.html",
            EnableInMainMenu = true,
            DisplayName = "Radarr Coming Soon Rules",
            MenuIcon = "rule_folder"
        },
        new PluginPageInfo
        {
            Name = "RadarrRulesPageJs",
            EmbeddedResourcePath = GetType().Namespace + ".Services.Models.Rules.rulesPage.js"
        }
    };
}

Critical — EmbeddedResourcePath must exactly match the compiled resource
name, which is derived from the file's actual location as declared in the
.csproj's <EmbeddedResource Include="..."> item, not an assumed folder.
Confirmed failure mode: registering the page with a path pointing at a
folder the file isn't actually in (UI.Rules.rulesPage.html) produces no
compile error — the mismatch only surfaces at request time, as:

System.IO.FileNotFoundException: File not found: RadarrRulesPage
   at Emby.Web.Api.WebAppService.Get(GetDashboardConfigurationPage request)

This confirms WebAppService.Get(GetDashboardConfigurationPage) is the
server-side handler for the configurationpage?name=X dashboard route —
the page registration (Name lookup) succeeded, but
Assembly.GetManifestResourceStream(EmbeddedResourcePath) returned null.
Fix: match EmbeddedResourcePath to the file's real path exactly, e.g. for
<EmbeddedResource Include="Services\Models\Rules\rulesPage.html" />, the
correct value is Namespace + ".Services.Models.Rules.rulesPage.html".


Confirmed working: ApiClient.ajax calling convention for a custom
plugin API surface, from the page's own JS (loaded via the .js
PluginPageInfo entry above, following the data-controller="__plugin/X"
binding convention used by autoorganizetv.js):

javascriptApiClient.ajax({
    type: 'GET',  // or 'POST'
    url: ApiClient.getUrl('ManageComingSoon/RadarrRuleSets'),
    data: JSON.stringify(payload), // POST only
    contentType: 'application/json', // POST only
    dataType: 'json'
}).then(function (result) { ... });

Server side, a plain MediaBrowser.Model.Services.IService class with
[Route]-decorated request DTOs (IReturn<T>) is auto-discovered the same
way as IChannel/IScheduledTask — no manual registration needed. Matches
the official dev.emby.media "Creating Api Endpoints" doc pattern exactly.
Confirmed working for both GET (Get(TRequest)) and POST
(Post(TRequest)) handler methods on the same service class.


Addendum: Custom Drag-and-Drop UI in Plugin Pages
(Rule-builder session — generalized for any future Emby plugin needing a custom interactive HTML/JS page)
Native HTML5 Drag-and-Drop is unreliable inside Emby's webview
Confirmed via extensive live testing: the standard draggable="true" / dragstart / dragover / drop / dataTransfer API produces inconsistent, hard-to-diagnose failures in Emby's client webview — universal "no entry" cursors regardless of what's under the pointer, drop targets that silently reject valid drops in some containers but not others, and drag operations that appear to grab unrelated sibling elements. Root causes identified across the session:

dataTransfer.types is not reliably readable during dragover in this environment — some drop-target-acceptance logic that checks e.dataTransfer.types before drop fires will silently fail even though the drag itself is real.
dropEffect must be explicitly set in every dragover handler, not just effectAllowed at dragstart. The cursor icon (including the universal "not allowed" symbol) is governed by whether dropEffect matches effectAllowed on the current dragover event — omitting this makes every drop target look rejected even when the underlying accept logic is correct.
Even with both fixed, native DnD initiation itself proved flaky in this specific client (symptoms: dragging one element visually appeared to drag several; cursor never resolved to a valid state anywhere).

Recommendation for any future Emby plugin page needing drag-and-drop: skip native HTML5 DnD entirely and build on raw Pointer Events instead. This is the approach that ultimately worked reliably:

pointerdown on a drag source starts the operation — create a floating "ghost" element (position: fixed, pointer-events: none) that follows the cursor via a pointermove listener on document.
Maintain a simple in-memory registry of drop targets: { el, acceptedKinds[], onDrop(value, ...) }. On every pointermove/pointerup, use document.elementFromPoint(x, y) to find what's under the cursor, then filter the registry for targets whose element contains that point and whose acceptedKinds matches the kind of thing currently being dragged.
When multiple registered targets can legitimately contain the same point (e.g. nested containers, one inside another), pick the most deeply nested match — the one that does not itself contain any other match. Getting this containment check backwards (picking the match that is contained by another, rather than the one that contains none) silently biases every drop toward the outermost/root container — a real bug encountered in this session that looked like "nested drops don't work" but was actually "nested drops always redirect to root."
No dataTransfer object is needed at all with this approach, which sidesteps every one of the native-DnD quirks above.
Remove draggable="true" from any element also wired for pointer-based dragging — leaving it in place risks the browser attempting its own native drag on the same gesture simultaneously, reintroducing conflicts.
For reordering within a list (as opposed to inserting a new item), compute the insertion point from the pointer's Y-coordinate relative to existing children (getBoundingClientRect() midpoints), and show an explicit visual insertion-line indicator at that computed position — a container-wide "you're somewhere in here" highlight alone is not enough for the user to know exactly where an item will land, especially once nesting is involved.

position: sticky + border-collapse: collapse renders incorrectly
A sticky first column/row in a <table> using border-collapse: collapse does not reliably paint opaque — content can visibly bleed through underneath during scroll, even with an explicit solid background-color set. This is a known cross-browser rendering interaction, not a background-color bug. Fix: use border-collapse: separate; border-spacing: 0; instead, combined with background-clip: padding-box and a z-index above sibling cell content on the sticky cell itself.
Emby theme CSS custom properties — confirmed real variable names
Emby's built-in theme exposes its accent color as three separate HSL component variables rather than a single flat color, composed via hsla() at the point of use:
css--theme-primary-color-hue
--theme-primary-color-saturation
--theme-primary-color-lightness
Confirmed real (found via DevTools inspection of .button-submit in the live client). Usage pattern:
cssbackground: hsla(var(--theme-primary-color-hue), var(--theme-primary-color-saturation), var(--theme-primary-color-lightness), 0.22);
No dedicated "surface/page background" variable was found — inspecting the main content surface's Computed panel showed no background-related custom property at all, suggesting the page background is painted further up the DOM (body/html) without being exposed as a themeable variable. Guessing a plausible-sounding variable name here would just reintroduce the same "hardcoded and possibly wrong" problem hardcoded hex values have — the correct approach when no confirmed variable exists is to read the actual resolved value at runtime via getComputedStyle(document.body).backgroundColor (falling back up to documentElement, then a last-resort literal) and expose that as a page-local CSS custom property. This stays correct across whatever theme is active without requiring foreknowledge of Emby's internal variable names.
Design nuance worth carrying forward: not everything should be theme-ified just because the capability exists. Where a plugin UI uses multiple hardcoded colors as deliberate semantic differentiation (e.g. this rule-builder's chip categories — field/operator/logic/not each a different fixed hue so they're distinguishable at a glance), collapsing them all onto the single theme accent color removes that signal rather than improving correctness. Reserve theme-variable usage for elements that are conceptually "primary/accent" (buttons, the most emphasized structural element), and keep intentional multi-color semantic coding as fixed values.
General debugging discipline for custom plugin pages

IHasWebPages embedded resources (.html/.js) are compiled into the plugin DLL, not served from disk — a browser hard-refresh (even DevTools "disable cache") does not pick up new plugin code. The plugin must be rebuilt and the Emby server restarted before any change is visible, every time. A large share of apparent "the fix didn't work" reports in this session were actually stale-server-code, not real regressions — always confirm via DevTools Sources tab (searching the actually-loaded file for a known-new string/comment) before spending further effort debugging a "still broken" report.
For anything involving live data shape (matching against a raw API response), a debug JSON view of the exact payload being sent/evaluated — a simple collapsible <pre> populated with JSON.stringify(payload, null, 2) — is disproportionately useful for resolving "is this a client bug or a server bug" questions quickly, versus continued back-and-forth speculation.


## Channel Subfolders (Folder-type ChannelItemInfo)

Confirmed via decompilation of `Emby.Server.Implementations.Channels.ChannelManager`
(the concrete `IChannelManager` implementation).

- `ChannelItemInfo.Type = ChannelItemType.Folder` plus `ChannelItemInfo.FolderType`
  (a second, separate enum: `Container, MusicAlbum, PhotoAlbum, MusicArtist, Series,
  Season`) together define a folder item. For a plain admin-defined subfolder
  (no special media-library semantics), use `FolderType = ChannelFolderType.Container`
  — this maps to a plain `Folder` BaseItem in `GetChannelItemEntity`
  (`Series`/`Season`/`PhotoAlbum` map to their respective specialized BaseItem
  subclasses instead; `Container` is the generic case).

- **`InternalChannelItemQuery.FolderId` is exactly the `ChannelItemInfo.Id` string
  previously returned for that folder.** Confirmed via `GetChannelItemEntity`
  (`baseItem.ExternalId = info.Id` on persist) and `GetChannelItemsInternal`
  (`externalFolderId = parentItem.ExternalId`, passed straight through as
  `InternalChannelItemQuery.FolderId` on the next call). Applies identically to
  both live user browse-in and scheduled "Refresh Internet Channels" recursion —
  there is only one internal call site (`ChannelManager.GetChannelItems`) for both.
  `FolderId` is `null` for the channel's own root-level `GetChannelItems` call.

- **Recursive refresh walks arbitrary depth, gated by `maxRefreshLevel`.**
  `RefreshChannel` defaults `maxRefreshLevel = 8` when Emby's own "Refresh
  Internet Channels" task calls `RefreshChannels()` with no explicit override.
  `GetAllItems` recurses: query children of the current parent → for each
  returned folder id, recurse at `currentRefreshLevel + 1`, stopping once
  `currentRefreshLevel >= maxRefreshLevel`. **Your `GetChannelItems` is called
  once per folder node in the tree per refresh pass** — an admin-built tree
  with many subfolders means many separate `GetChannelItems` invocations per
  cycle. Reinforces Cached mode (read a local per-folder cache; never call
  Radarr/Sonarr live per node) as the right default for any tree deeper than
  the flat root case already using it.

- **`RefreshChannelContent`'s `restrictTopLevelFolderId` does NOT skip the root
  call.** Confirmed: the root call `GetChannelItems(FolderId=null)` always
  happens first and reconciles the channel's direct/root children regardless
  of this parameter. Only the subsequent *recursion set* is overridden — Emby
  looks up a BaseItem by `ExternalId == restrictTopLevelFolderId` (a
  library-wide lookup, not scoped to this channel specifically) and recurses
  into only that subtree instead of everything the root call returned. Useful
  for "refresh just Studio A" but budget for the root fetch always running too.

- **Deletion/reconciliation (implicit, per `Evidence.md`'s existing "Item
  Removal" section) is scoped per-parent-folder, not global.** In
  `GetChannelItemsInternal`, the existing-DB-items set being diffed against
  your returned list is queried with `ParentIds = [thisFoldersInternalId]`
  (or `Parent = channel` at the true root). An item missing from one folder's
  `GetChannelItems` response is only ever deleted from that folder — sibling
  folders' contents are untouched by another folder's sync pass.

- **Folder metadata refresh is selective.** For an existing (already-persisted)
  folder item with `FolderType == Container`, only `Name` is checked/updated
  on repeat syncs (cheap rename propagation) — not a full field rewrite like
  new items get. `_providerManager.QueueRefresh` (Emby's own external
  metadata-provider pipeline) is only queued for `FolderType` of `Series` or
  `Season` — **never for `Container`** — so plain admin subfolders are never
  sent through metadata scraping.

- **Media items do get queued for Emby's own metadata refresh.** Confirmed via
  `ChannelMediaContentType` ordinals (`Clip=0, Podcast=1, Trailer=2, Movie=3,
  Episode=4, ...`): `GetChannelItemEntity`'s stale-refresh branch queues
  `_providerManager.QueueRefresh` only for `Trailer`/`Movie`/`Episode` content
  types. Since `RadarrComingSoonChannel` items use `ContentType =
  ChannelMediaContentType.Movie`, they ARE queued for Emby's own metadata
  provider lookups on refresh — independent of and in addition to whatever
  data this plugin populates directly. Not previously documented.

- **`IHasChannelFeatures` (optional interface, same opt-in pattern as
  `IRequiresMediaInfoCallback`/`ISupportsDelete`) is NOT required for a
  subfolder tree.** `ChannelManager.GetUserViewItems` only branches on it to
  decide whether to show root-level folders as separate top-level library
  entries (`ShowRootFoldersAtTopLevel`); without it (current
  `RadarrComingSoonChannel` state), the channel always presents as a single
  top-level entry with everything — including any subfolder tree — nested
  underneath via ordinary folder browsing. This matches "root channel folder
  always exists, subfolders are purely additive" with zero extra interface work.

- **Server-side media-info caching exists independent of anything this plugin
  does.** `ChannelManager` holds its own `ConcurrentDictionary` cache of
  `IRequiresMediaInfoCallback.GetChannelItemMediaInfo` results, keyed by item
  id, with a confirmed 5-minute TTL (`(DateTimeOffset.UtcNow - cached).TotalMinutes
  < 5.0`). This is separate from and in addition to `RadarrComingSoonChannel`'s
  own file-based cache (`RadarrChannelCache`) — the two operate at different
  layers (playback media-source resolution vs.

  DI / constructor injection

Emby's container reliably supports named concrete-class constructor parameters, multi-level deep (confirmed via RadarrClient's whole dependency chain flowing into auto-discovered RadarrComingSoonChannel).
It does not have confirmed support for collection injection (IEnumerable<T>/params T[] against a custom interface). Don't assume it works — design registries with named parameters (Registry(ProviderA a, ProviderB b)) instead, even though it's less "open/closed." Confirm collection injection explicitly before relying on it, then update the pattern once proven.
IChannel / IScheduledTask / IService are auto-discovered via GetExports<T>() — the container constructs them, not your plugin code. You cannot hand a manually-built singleton into their constructors the way you can with your own IHasUIPages controllers (which are manually new'd in the plugin class). Any dependency an auto-discovered class needs must itself be container-resolvable.

Channel/folder mechanics (if any future plugin touches IChannel)

InternalChannelItemQuery.FolderId is exactly the ChannelItemInfo.Id you previously returned for that folder — round-trips verbatim.
Folder items need both Type = ChannelItemType.Folder and FolderType (a separate enum) — Container for a plain generic folder; Series/Season/PhotoAlbum map to specialized BaseItem subclasses and get queued for real metadata scraping, Container never does.
Recursive refresh depth is a real, configurable int (maxRefreshLevel, default 8) — Emby walks the tree calling GetChannelItems once per folder node. Reconciliation (add/remove) is scoped per-parent-folder, not global — a folder's own returned list only ever affects that folder's children.
Server already caches IRequiresMediaInfoCallback.GetChannelItemMediaInfo results for 5 minutes — don't assume you need to build that caching yourself.

## IHttpClient (CoreHttpClientManager) — automatic-timeout cooldown is keyed by host:port, not full URL

Confirmed via ILSpy decompilation of Emby.Server.Implementations.HttpClientManager.CoreHttpClientManager
and its base BaseHttpClientManager.

`GetConnectionContextInternal` builds its per-connection cache key from
`BaseHttpClientManager.GetHostFromUrl(url)` (host:port only — scheme,
path, and query are stripped) plus compression/userinfo/timeout settings.
This means requests to the same host:port on different schemes (http vs
https) or different paths share the same cached `HttpClientInfo`,
including its `LastTimeout` field.

`SendAsyncInternal` checks, before attempting any request:
```csharp
if (options.EnableAutomaticTimeouts && (DateTimeOffset.UtcNow - client.LastTimeout).TotalSeconds < 30.0)
    throw new HttpException("Cancelling connection ... due to a previous timeout.") { IsTimedOut = true };
```
Any failure (including an unrelated one, e.g. wrong scheme) re-stamps
`LastTimeout`. Any other request to the same host:port within the next 30
seconds is rejected immediately, with no real network attempt — even if
it would have succeeded, and even if it's a different endpoint on that
host.

Practical implication: any "test connection" / probe-style call that a
user might reasonably retry quickly after a failure should set
`HttpRequestOptions.EnableAutomaticTimeouts = false` explicitly, so a
manual retry always gets a genuine attempt. Confirmed precedent for this
exact pattern already exists in Emby's own code
(`SharedHttpPipelineSource.FindMediaFromHlsVariantPlaylist`). Leave the
default (`true`) for steady-state background/scheduled fetches, where
automatic backoff against a genuinely unreachable host is desirable.

## Plugin Web-UI Asset Caching (WebAppService.Get(GetDashboardConfigurationPage))

Confirmed via ILSpy decompilation of Emby.Web.Api.WebAppService.

Custom plugin pages registered via `IHasWebPages`/`PluginPageInfo`
(`.js`/`.css`/`.template.html` embedded resources) are served through
`_resultFactory.GetStaticResult`, with the cache key computed as:

```csharp
plugin.Version.ToString().GetMD5()
```

**Key implication:** the cache key depends only on the plugin assembly's
own `Version` string — nothing else. Not a content hash, not the file's
`Last-Modified` time, not a build timestamp. Rebuilding and restarting the
plugin with an unchanged `<Version>` produces an identical cache key, so
both the browser and (per the same code path) Emby's own static-result
cache will keep serving the previously-cached bytes indefinitely. This is
the mechanism behind "my JS/HTML changes don't show up until I hard-refresh"
during plugin development — it's expected behavior given how the key is
built, not a bug or a browser quirk.

**Practical implications for any future Emby plugin with custom web pages:**

- A DevTools "disable cache" + hard-refresh (or an incognito window) always
  works as a manual workaround, since it bypasses the cache lookup rather
  than needing to invalidate it.
- The reliable structural fix is to make the plugin's `Version` change on
  every build that touches a cached asset, since that's the only input to
  the key. A manual version bump works but is easy to forget with no
  obvious symptom when you do. Deriving the version automatically from the
  build (e.g. a timestamp-based last component via MSBuild) removes the
  human step entirely, at the cost of the version number no longer being
  meaningful semver — worth weighing against whether the plugin is
  personal/in-development versus something distributed where a real
  version number matters to others.
- Images/fonts get a separate, much longer-lived cache path
  (`EnableDashboardResponseCaching` + a `v` query param, or MIME-type-based
  365-day caching) that isn't tied to plugin version at all — if a plugin's
  embedded image/font assets ever seem stuck, the fix path is different
  from the JS/HTML/CSS one described here.
